Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
a0-a7 a2
Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
in 26:	45b1                	li	a1,12 被内联了
14:	250d                	addiw	a0,a0,3 也是被内联了

At what address is the function printf located?
  34:	5f8080e7          	jalr	1528(ra) # 628 <printf>
628

What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
What is the output? Here's an ASCII table that maps bytes to characters.
The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?

Here's a description of little- and big-endian and a more whimsical description.

In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
只给了一个参数，但是却有两个占位符，第二个占位符的值取决于a2的值
